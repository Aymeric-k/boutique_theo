                Recently, I embarked on a new venture by opening my own e-commerce store. Here, I curate a collection of print stickers and rugs featuring my original designs. With meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to quality, I ensure that each product is crafted using premium materials, resulting in durable and visually stunning pieces.
